====================
TODO file for Recode
====================

Tell rrt@sc3d.org if you feel like volunteering
for any of these ideas, listed more or less in decreasing order
of priority.

Before next official release
============================

+ Revise everything about explodes.
+ Update NEWS for latest libiconv and latest Keld tables.
+ Remove TeX edition warnings, rephrase whatever required.
+ Complete inter-node and menu references, as necessary.

Keld
====

+ recode

  + New tables from Keld
  + Revise diagnostics

+ Standards aspects

  + Wait for PostScript

    + charset in 14652
    + transliteration in 14652
    + API in 15435
    + recoding/iconv APIs (->Handa)

+ Miscellaneous

  + African tables
  + Unicode/W3C short-comings

    + Lithuanian

Particular notes
================

+ feuille Tamil
+ New RFC 1345 tables, still some diagnostics

Charsets
========

+ Clean up applemac vs macintosh and ibmpc vs ibm437.
+ Implement RFC1345 more fully.
+ Generalize older charsets (latex, texte, etc.) to RFC 1345 mnemonics.
+ Support VT320 support and related character sets.  (Alain Simon)
+ Support @code{[nt]roff} diacritics.
+ Support Universite de Montreal *accent* convention.

Surfaces
========

+ Implement some invbits over 8, 7 or 6 bits, maybe more.
+ CR-LF, in ibmpc.c (implied by IBMPC?)
+ CR, in applemac.c (implied by Apple-Mac?)
+ Message headers [RFC 1342]
+ Mnemonic and Mnemo (maybe?) [RFC 1345]
+ Integrate -c and -g into charsets.
+ Find something for ``recode -g ibmpc:ibmpc`` to do what it suggests
+ Option -M (implying -i) to process MIME headers

Mechanics
=========

+ Intercept signals to cleanup the temporary files in any event.
+ Revise --sequence=pipe thoroughly.
+ Rewrite execute_pipe_sequence for having only one child per parent.
+ Revise --force thoroughly.
+ Rewrite .l converses for lat1{asci,ltex,txte}, for --force.
+ Optimize/merge all one-to-many cases.
+ Write a better ``make check``, not as partial and forgiving.
+ Have -l know which output charset to use (Martin Maechler, 93-12-07).
+ Take note that ->RFC1345 recodings are non reversible.

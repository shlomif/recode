README file for :file:`recode/contrib/`
=======================================

The :file:`contrib/` directory of the Recode distribution contains a few
miscellaneous tools, which have been collected here and there, a bit
randomly, for your possible entertainment or use.

Beware that nothing here is supported by the Recode maintainer, you
might have to contact the authors directly to get support.  There is no
guarantee that any file in this directory will still exist in subsequent
releases.  Finally, there is no guarantee either that I will accept to
include contributions, unless I find them very good or very small.  But
I'm quite willing to give `URL pointers`__ to other tools.

__ /index.html#external-pointers

To the best of my knowledge, all included files are free, and already
available widely by other means.  I did not collect any kind legalistic
papers proving that the contained material is indeed free.  In case of a
dispute, or at the mere request of the author, I'll quickly remove any
dubious material.  So, do not consider the files here as being as *safe*
as the things you usually get from the Free Software Foundation.

Please drop me a note about what you found to be useful, in here, to
help me at deciding what should be kept and what should go away.

    This is a miscellaneous collection of tools, documented in French,
    for using Recode from Emacs, when Latin-1 is in use.  Submitted by
    Fran√ßois Pinard <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>, 1994-12.
